Iris
====

My map for an Iris keyboard.  

Started with default, and changed a few keys

Added a single RGB LED to the left hand, (5mm through-hole neopixel from adafruit), I can now see when layer has changed.



Make example for this keyboard (after setting up your build environment):

    make iris/rev2:greenshadowmaker

Example of flashing this keyboard:

    make iris/rev2:greenshadowmaker:avrdude
